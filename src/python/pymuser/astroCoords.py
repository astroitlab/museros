==============

Some useful functions for converting in between Right Ascension (hours,mins,secs)
and Declination (degrees,mins,secs) to degrees and radians. These functions are
all named in the same format: a2b(), where a is the original data, and b is the new
data format.

All of this type of basic stuff can be done with pyEphem or similar, but I wanted
something super simple.
